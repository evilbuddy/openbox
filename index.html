	<h1>GIC</h1>
	<p>The GIC (Gmod Inter Chat) is an addon allowing players to talk even though they are not in the same server.<br>
		It works in singleplayer and multiplayer, and is present in the server's collection.<br>
		You can disable it (and only talk in the server's chat) by using <span>gic_enabled false</span> (and enable it with <span> gic_enabled true</span>)<br>
		You also can talk with GIC users when you are not in-game using <a href="https://gic.elementfx.com/">the desktop app</a> !<br>
	You should also check the Shared Pos DLC, which allows you to play with other users who are on the same map in singleplayer !</p>

	<h1>HUD</h1>
	<p>The server has a custom HUD (WIP) that can be toggled with <span>obhud 0</span> or <span>1</span><br>
	You can change the theme with <span>obhud_colortheme</span> (currently mocha and latte)<br>
	If it doesn't load, execute <span>obhud_kill</span> in the console, and then run <span>lua_openscript_cl hud.lua</span></p>

	<h1>Missing Content (ERROR models or black & pink textures)</h1>
	<p>The server contains CS:S, HL2 EP1 & EP2 and TF2 content, which you also need to download in order to see them<br>
	This can be done in two different ways:<br>
	1. Buy the games on Steam (Counter-Strike: Source (10€), Half-Life 2 (10€), Team-Fortress 2 (free)) and mount them in your game ("games" button at the bottom-right of the main menu)<br>
	2. Download them from <a href="https://gmodcontent.com/">GmodContent</a> and extract the archives into your addons folder (right-click gmod on steam > manage > browse local files > <span>garrysmod/addons</span><br>
	If you do that, be sure to extract them in subfolders (<span>garrysmod/addons/css-content/materials sounds models</span>) for each game</p>
